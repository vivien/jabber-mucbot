    # Creates a new Jabber::MUCBot object with the specified +config+ Hash,
    # which must contain +nick+, +password+, +server+, and +room+ at a minimum.
    #
    # You may optionally give a +debug+ option. If it is omitted, it will be
    # set to false and no debug messages will be printed.
    #
    # You may optionally give a +keep_alive+ option. If it is omitted,
    # it will be set to true and Thread.stop will be called.
    # That is useful to set it to false if you have a main loop
    # in your bot algorithm or if you simply want to call others methods
    # like :send after join.
    #
    # The bot will be +public+.
    #
    # By default, a Jabber::MUCBot has no command.
    #
    #   # A confiugured MUC Bot.

    # Add a command to the bot's repertoire.
    #
    # Commands consist of a regular expression and a callback block.
    # The regular expression (+regex+) is used to detect the presence of
    # the command in an incoming message.
    #
    # The specified callback block will be triggered when the bot receives a
    # message that matches the given command regex. The callback block
    # will have access to the sender and the message text (not including
    # the command itsef), and should either return a String response
    # or +nil+. If a callback block returns a String response, the response will
    # be sent to the room.
    #
    # Examples:
    #
    #   # Say 'puts foo' and 'foo' will be written to $stdout.
    #   # The bot will also respond with "'foo' written to $stdout."
    #   add_command(/^puts\s+.+$/) do |sender, message|
    #     puts "#{sender} says #{message}."
    #     "'#{message}' written to $stdout."
    #   end
    #
    #   # 'puts!' is a non-responding version of 'puts'.
    #   add_command(/^puts!\s+.+$/) do |sender, message|
    #     puts "#{sender} says #{message}."
    #     nil
    #   end
    #
    #  # 'rand' is a command that produces a random number from 0 to 10
    #  add_command(/^rand$/) { rand(10).to_s }
    #
    def add_command(regex, &callback)
      # Add the command spec - used for parsing incoming commands.
